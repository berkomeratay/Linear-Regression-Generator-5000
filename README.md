# Linear-Regression-Generator-5000
A fun project for establishing a GUI for linear regression analysis. For the data analysis extensions of excel, .csv and .dta can be used. User is asked to enter the directory of the dataset. After that, a new window opens for the selection of dependent and independent variables. At the end the results of the regression analysis printed out in a new window while results are also saved in a .txt file in the directory of the .py file. A background image has been used in the codes while any .gif image can be used as parallel with users preferences. In order to not to get an error one should not forget to put a .gif file in the directory of this .py file in the same name with the one in the code. The image used in the codes and an example dataset can be found in this repository.
